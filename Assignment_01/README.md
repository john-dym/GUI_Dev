# Drug Dispenser UI
*Author*: John Morales
*Design tool*: Pencil

## Design 1 Remarks
![[CPSC3118 - GUI Dev/GUI_Dev/Assignment_01/Design_01/main_window.png]]
* Presents detailed information so that the user knows exactly what to expect of the drug dispense so that they can verify the dispensed contents.
## Design 2 Remarks
![[CPSC3118 - GUI Dev/GUI_Dev/Assignment_01/Design_02/main_window.png]]
* Gives the dates for the entire week and time. The user can use this information for non drug dispensing related tasks.
* Minimal information presented to not confuse the user
## Additional Windows Remarks
![[inventory.png]]
* Gives a complete overview of all medicine and quantity the machine currently has.

* Chose to use a dialog box when changing the quantity to prevent accidental change when interfacing with the edit medicine function

* Can add multiple schedules to individual medicines
* Made it where you select a single time but multiple days. It is more likely the user will take medicines at the same time but different days. This is to limit the amount of interactions needed to set a schedule versus retyping the time in for each individual day.
## Favorite Features
* I like the main window of design 1 for its detailed info.
- The inventory screen gives a quick glance of any medicine that may need to be refilled.
