## Tools
* Python PAGE - https://page.sourceforge.net/
* PyCharm Professional

## Issues
* Page GUI Builder constantly throws an exception either permission denies or namespace error. Thought the permission error was because of using OneDrive to store the saved files but that was not the case.
* Page GUI Builder bug where if you start working in a large resolution monitor and save the work window locations and then try to open PAGE again but in a smaller resolution (from 5140x1440 to 1920x1080) the program will get stuck trying to load the workspace.
